Overview

CMSnipcart is a Joomla! component for building an ecommerce website powered by `Snipcart <https://www.snipcart.com/>`_ and `Joomla! CMS <https://www.joomla.org/>`_.

Snipcart is a "lean, powerful HTML/JavaScript shopping cart" which can be used on any website. You just need to include some lines of code and start selling, Snipcart takes care of your payments, order history, your customers... so you can have a shopping site running quickly. There is no setup fee or monthly fee, Snipcart takes a small 2% fee of your sale or only $10 fee if your monthly sales are under $500. You can find more info about Snipcart at `https://www.snipcart.com/ <https://www.snipcart.com/>`_.

Because Snipcart is an HTML/JavaScript shopping cart, you can find it difficult to setup your site if you are not a web developer or if you are not familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. CMSnipcart helps you do all of the technical tasks to have a Joomla! website with Snipcart integrated.
